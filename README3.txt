Read me for Phase 3:
  This phase was somewhat easy, somewhat not. What made it easy was determining was ADT to use in which was Priority Queue. Not only was it recommended to use Priority queue in phase 3, it makes sense to use the ADT to prioritize which weapons to use and within it when to use it depending on the their shields, armor, or hull levels. 
  The somewhat challenging part was to implement it. As Maddie implemented the priority queue class from their lab, it was the matter of how to implement the class into the set_targets(). After a few tries to try to get one stratgey to work, we were then able to implement other strategies easily. Even making one strategy of our own.
  As we have tested throughout the process by running the simulation, we were able to make changes to when our strategies would work and to edit our student.txt fleet file.
We tested our strategy for 10 games. Out of the 10 games, we wont 7 of them. We know our strategy is not perfect as this gives us a winning perctange of only 70%. If we were to have more time for this project, we could probably improve our strategy even more to be at least 90%.
