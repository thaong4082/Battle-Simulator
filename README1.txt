Read me for Phase 1:
For Phase 1, that biggest challenge was understanding how all the parts intertwined with each other. My partner and I spent 13.5 hours total on phase 1. We attended office hours and study groups to help understand what the various attributes meant for each ship. It would have been extremely helpful if we went over phase 1, 2, and 3 as a class before it was assigned to ensure everyone was on the same page.
Having the testing files were extremely helpful. When in a pinch for time, we tried to understand what was being asked of us by using the tests from the testing files.
We are about 99.9% positive that all of our Phase 1 works. For Phase 1, we found it easiest to create helper methods to assign common attributes such as the cost, base values, and evasion - this was to ensure that relationships between objects were correct. 
Creating the weapons was a much easier task. It was straightforward and had langauge that we were familiar with. Weapons was the easiest to utulize inheritance, in our opinion.
The reading fleet file was very difficult for us. We felt as if we had very limited experience and understanding of os, so Professor Kumar had to help us a lot with that.
To test Phase 1, we used the mess.txt and maddietesting.py to visualize our program easier. The test cases just throw errors so it was hard to know what was actually being done. This was the best way we could come up with to ensure values were being assgned correctly.
