Read me for Phase 2:

  The biggest challenge was getting started with phase 2, primarily get_weapons() and fire(). As there were many conditions with fire(), it was difficult processing what needed to get done and where, basically organizing it. Another difficult thing was accuracy and evasion with fire() as it was not mentioned as much compared to the other conditionals. Eventually went to office hours for some help.
  After overcoming those two methods, it was smooth sailing from there with fleet stats and report as it good practice with dictionary and __str__. However, __str__ was hard as the tests_phase2.py was picky with the formatting of __str__.
  Overall, this was a somewhat difficult phase as we were coming back from thanksgiving break. However, this was not as difficult as phase 1 as we now have a better understanding of this project.
